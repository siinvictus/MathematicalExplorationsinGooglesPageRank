Purpose: Explore and understand mathematically Google's page rank algorithm. 

Go through the files in the following manner: 
1. See pdf GoogleVersionfixed for the description on the algorithms, the mathematical background and questions.
2. See the second pdf BashllariQaderi_UnderstandingGooglesPageRank on our solutions on the questions presented in the first document.
3. See the the .ipynb file for some of the exercises that are not mathematical proofs but require the solution of real examples.
